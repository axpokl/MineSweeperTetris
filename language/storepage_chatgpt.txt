Introduction
Minesweeper Tetris is a new 2D casual game that combines the best elements of two classic games, Minesweeper and Tetris. 
The main difference from traditional Minesweeper is that the minefield in Minesweeper Tetris is constantly growing upwards, and the game does not end immediately when hitting a mine by mistake. Instead, a punishment occurs: the minefield instantly increases by two lines until it reaches the edge.
Similar to Tetris, a row is cleared when all the mines in a row are found. When the game board has less than four lines, the game triggers Tetris: four lines are immediately added, and massive points are awarded. 
As the score increases, the game levels up, and the minefield grows faster, making the game more challenging and exciting.
There are three standard minefields in the game: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The game board can also be customized by changing the size of the board and the number of mines through shortcut keys. 
When the game is over, the score is recorded on the high score list. There are five leaderboards in the game, allowing players to compete in various skills.
Gameplay
Unlike traditional Minesweeper, right-clicking marks a block with a question mark instead of a flag. A block is only marked as a flag when it is absolutely certain to be a mine, e.g., left-clicking on a mine. 
A block can be marked as a flag by clicking on the number around it, and it is not necessary to click both left and right buttons simultaneously. The game will automatically and intelligently mark the flag according to the situation of marked, unmarked blocks, and mines. 
The four drag modes in the game make the gameplay smoother, increase the speed of minesweeping, and result in higher scores.
For fairness, the game has an AI system. When the AI judges that there is no solution to the block on the game board, clicking on the mines will not cause punishment.
