3. My mind is filled with questions
   Mark [b]every single tile[/b] on the board with a question mark (?). Recommended: [b]shrink the board[/b] size and use ‚Äú[b]Drag All[/b]‚Äù mode to mark quickly.

5. Struggling on the line of death
   When the board is [b]nearly full, survive[/b] by clearing a line at the last second. Tip: flag all but one mine in a line, mark the last with a question mark, and trigger it just before failure. Best done [b]early [/b]when mine growth is slower.

üü® C. Accumulated Achievements
